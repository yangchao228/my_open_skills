# Wenchang WeChat Writer

This skill turns a confirmed topic into a WeChat-style long-form draft. It should receive a topic brief, outline, evidence pack, or `content_state`.

## Inputs

- confirmed topic or angle
- target reader
- evidence pack, if facts are important
- preferred length and tone, if provided
- existing `content_state`

If the topic is fact-heavy and has no evidence pack, route to `wenchang-research` before drafting.

## Output

1. 8-12 title candidates
2. 3-5 opening hooks
3. article outline
4. full draft
5. ending and discussion prompt
6. structural visual anchors that may deserve later illustration assessment
7. follow-up topics

## Writing Rules

- Start with a clear problem or judgment.
- Give the reader a concrete gain: judgment, method, case, checklist, or next action.
- Use evidence and examples close to the claims they support.
- Keep headings short and useful.
- Avoid generic AI-news tone, empty trend commentary, and template-heavy phrasing.
- Preserve human judgment; do not make the article sound like a generic summary.

## Output Format

## Draft

## Ending

## Structural Visual Anchors

## Follow-up Topics
- <topic>

## content_state Update
```yaml

    stop_condition:

```

## Boundaries

- Do not invent facts to make the draft stronger.
- Do not bury missing evidence.
- Do not produce final summaries, sharing copy, tags, cover copy, or illustration plans; use `wenchang-publish-check` after review and `article-to-illustrations` after preflight.
- Do not use private account identity or private project material unless the user provides it for the current run.
