# Wenchang Review

Wenchang Review evaluates whether a draft deserves more work and what the smallest useful next action is.

## Modes

Default to diagnosis mode. Use full-edit mode only when the user explicitly asks to edit, rewrite, cut, polish, or produce a publishable version.

### Diagnosis Mode

Return issues and minimum fixes. Do not rewrite the full article.

### Full-Edit Mode

Return an edited draft after diagnosing. Prioritize:

1. argument strength
2. evidence near claims
3. reader value
4. readable structure
5. clean prose

## Diagnosis Dimensions

- core problem clarity
- structure and flow
- reader gain
- evidence and examples
- human judgment and specificity
- platform fit
- long-term asset value
- risks: empty trend talk, tool manual tone, overpromised title, unsupported claims

## Diagnosis Output

## Edit Decision
- Main original problem:

- Still needs user confirmation:

## Strongest Line
<one sentence worth keeping>
```

## Boundaries

- Do not default to full rewrite.
- Do not preserve unsupported claims for smoother prose.
- Do not change the author's core position silently.
- If the core position fails, return a diagnosis instead of hiding the failure with editing.
